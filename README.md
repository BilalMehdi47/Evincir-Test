1. Dependencies Used & Why:
   I used the following dependencies in this project:
- flutter_screenutil: This package is used for responsive UI design. It helps in adapting the UI to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring a consistent look and feel across various devices.
- simple_ruler_picker: This package provides a simple and customizable ruler picker widget. It is useful for selecting numerical values in a user-friendly manner, making it ideal for applications that require precise input from users.

2. Project Structure:

- assets/images/: This directory contains all the image assets used in the application.
- lib/main.dart: This is the main entry point of the Flutter application. It contains the main function and sets up the initial widget tree.
- lib/constants/: This directory contains constant values used throughout the application, such as colors, text styles, and other reusable constants.
- lib/features/: This directory is organized by features of the application. Each feature has its own subdirectory containing related widgets, models, and services.
